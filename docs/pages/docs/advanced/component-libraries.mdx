# Using Other Component Libraries

While BlockNote's default UI uses the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) component library, you can configure it to use other libraries instead.

## Using Ariakit/ShadCN

BlockNote has plug & play support for [Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/) and [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/). You can switch to them just by importing `BlockNoteView` from either `@blocknote/ariakit` or `@blocknote/shadcn` instead of `@blocknote/mantine`, as well as the corresponding CSS file.

<Example name="basic/ariakit" />

<Example name="basic/shadcn" />

## ShadCN Customization

If you want BlockNote to use customized ShadCN components instead of the default ones, you can pass them using the `shadCNComponents` prop of `BlockNoteView`:

```tsx
return (
  <BlockNoteView editor={editor} shadCNComponents={{
    Select: {
      SelectTrigger: ...,
      SelectContent: ...,
      ...
    },
    Button: {
      ...
    },
    ...
  }} />
);
```

You can pass components from the following ShadCN modules:

- Badge
- Button
- Card
- DropdownMenu
- Form
- Input
- Label
- Popover
- Select
- Tabs
- Toggle
- Tooltip

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    To ensure compatibility, your ShadCN components should not use Portals, as styling and CSS variables are scoped to only the editor.
</Callout>

## Using Your Own Components

If you want to use a different component library to Mantine/Ariakit/ShadCN, you will have to provide your own `BlockNoteView` implementation using the `BlockNoteViewRaw` component and a `ComponentsContext`:

```tsx
import { BlockSchema, InlineContentSchema, StyleSchema } from "@blocknote/core";
import {
  BlockNoteViewRaw,
  Components,
  ComponentsContext,
} from "@blocknote/react";
import { ComponentProps } from "react";

export const components: Components = {
  ...
};

export const BlockNoteView = <
  BSchema extends BlockSchema,
  ISchema extends InlineContentSchema,
  SSchema extends StyleSchema
>(
  props: ComponentProps<typeof BlockNoteViewRaw<BSchema, ISchema, SSchema>>
) => {
  return (
    <ComponentsContext.Provider value={components}>
      <BlockNoteViewRaw {...props} />
    </ComponentsContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

The components you want BlockNote to use should be added to `components`. To see exactly how this object is structured, which components you need to provide, and what props each component should take, see [this source file](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/tree/main/packages/react/src/editor/ComponentsContext.tsx).
