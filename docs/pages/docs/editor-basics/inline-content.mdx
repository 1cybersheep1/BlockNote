# Intro to Inline Content

Many blocks contain inline content. This page explains what inline content is, and how it's represented in code.

## Inline Content Objects

A block's content is referred to as inline content, and is used to represent rich text.

TODO: Between custom & default inline content types, the shapes on inline content objects are not standardized.
e.g. `Link`s have `href` and no props, custom IC will have props. `StyledText` can be IC itself, or used in other IC types.

I think we should have smth like this:
```typescript
// Helper types
type Styles = {
  bold: boolean;
  textColor: string;
  ...
}

// Inline Content types
type StyledText = {
  type: "richText";
  props: {
    styles: Styles;
  }
  editable: true;
}
type Link = {
  type: "link";
  props: {
    styles: Styles;
    href: string;
  }
  editable: true;
}
type Mention = {
  type: "mention";
  props: {
    user: string;
  }
  editable: false;
}
```
This is way cleaner, but means that links cannot have mixed styles. I think we either:
- Convert links to styles (they're already marks in TipTap)
- Not do anything bc I don't think having mixed styles on links is ever useful

## Table Content

Most blocks use an array of `InlineContent` objects to describe their content, but tables are slightly different. Table blocks have `TableContent` as their content, in which each row contains an array of cells, that each have an array of `InlineContent` objects.

```typescript
type TableContent = {
  type: "tableContent";
  rows: {
    cells: InlineContent[][];
  }[];
};
```

## Displaying Block Content

In the example below, you can see how a block with the content, "Hello __there__, [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org)", is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects:
