# Intro to Blocks

Each BlockNote editor is made up of a list of blocks. This page explains what blocks are, and how they're represented in code.

## Block Objects

A block - like a heading, paragraph, or list item - contains a piece of content and optionally nested blocks:

<img
  src="/img/screenshots/block_structure.png"
  alt="image"
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

In code, the `Block` type is used to describe any given block in the editor:

```typescript
type Block = {
  id: string;
  type: string; // the block type, e.g. 'paragraph', 'heading'
  props: Record<string, any>; // exact props depends on the Block type
  content: InlineContent[] | TableContent | undefined;
  children: Block[];
};
```

`id:` The block's ID. Multiple blocks cannot share a single ID, and a block will keep the same ID from when it's created until it's removed.

`type:` The block's type, such as a paragraph, heading, or list item. For an overview of built-in block types, see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-blocks).

`props:` The block's properties, which are stored in a set of key/value pairs and specify how the block looks and behaves. Different block types have different props - see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-blocks) for more.

`content:` The block's rich text content, usually represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. This does not include content from any nested blocks. For more information visit [Intro to Inline Content](/docs/editor-api/block-content).

[Table](/docs/editor-basics/default-blocks#table) blocks are slightly different, as they contain `TableContent`, where each table cell is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. Some blocks, like [Image](/docs/editor-basics/default-blocks#image) blocks, don't contain any rich text content, so their `content` is `undefined`.

`children:` Any blocks nested inside the block. The nested blocks are also represented using `Block` objects.

## Displaying Editor Content

After [creating an editor](/docs/editor-basics/editor#creating-the-editor), you'll have a `BlockNoteEditor` object, which exposes various functions to read and modify the editor.

We'll go through the full API later, but let's start with a simple example that shows the editor content - notice that it's in JSON as an array of `Block` objects.
