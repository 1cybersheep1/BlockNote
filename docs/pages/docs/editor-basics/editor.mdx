# Editor Setup

While BlockNote is ready to use out-of-the-box, there are a number of setup options you can choose to fit your use case.

## Creating the Editor

### Using a React Hook

Most of the time, you'll want to create the BlockNote editor using the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This will create a new editor when your React component gets mounted, and accepts a dependency array as with other React hooks.

```ts
useCreateBlockNote = (
  options?: Partial<BlockNoteEditorOptions>,
  deps?: React.DependencyList,
) => BlockNoteEditor;
```

Read on to [Options](/docs/editor-basics/editor#options) to see what options you can pass to the editor.

### Using a Method

You can also create a new editor using `BlockNoteEditor.create`. You should use this when you want to wait after your React component gets mounted before creating the editor.

```ts
BlockNoteEditor.create = (options?: Partial<BlockNoteEditorOptions>) =>
  BlockNoteEditor;
```

In the demo below, we use `BlockNoteEditor.create` so we can fetch the editor's initial content from `localStorage` before creating it.

<Example name="basic/saving-loading" />

Read on to [Options](/docs/editor-basics/editor#options) to see what options you can pass to the editor.

### Options

There are a number of options that you can pass to `useCreateBlockNote()` and `BlockNoteEditor.create`. You can find the full list of these below:

```typescript
export type BlockNoteEditorOptions = Partial<{
  initialContent: PartialBlock[];
  domAttributes: Record<string, string>;
  slashMenuItems: ReactSlashMenuItem[];
  defaultStyles: boolean;
  uploadFile: (file: File) => Promise<string>;
  collaboration: CollaborationOptions;
  blockSpecs: BlockSpecs;
  inlineContentSpecs: InlineContentSpecs;
  styleSpecs: StyleSpecs;
}>;
```

`initialContent:` The content that should be in the editor when it's created, represented as an array of [partial block objects](/docs/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks).

`domAttributes:` An object containing HTML attributes that should be added to various DOM elements in the editor. See [Adding DOM Attributes](/docs/theming#adding-dom-attributes) for more.

`slashMenuItems:` The commands that are listed in the editor's [Slash Menu](/docs/slash-menu). If this option isn't defined, a default list of commands is loaded.

`defaultStyles`: Whether to use the default font and reset the styles of `<p>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`, etc. elements that are used in BlockNote. Defaults to true if undefined.

`uploadFile`: A function which handles file uploads and eventually returns the URL to the uploaded file. Used by the [Image Toolbar](/docs/image-toolbar).

`collaboration`: Options for enabling real-time collaboration. See [Collaboration](/docs/collaboration) for more info.

`blockSpecs` (_advanced_): _advanced_ Specifications for Custom Blocks. See [Block Specs](/docs/block-specs) more info.

`inlineContentSpecs` (_advanced_): Specifications for Custom Inline Content. See [Inline Content Specs](/docs/inline-content-specs) for more info.

`styleSpecs` (_advanced_): Specifications for Custom Styles. See [Style Specs](/docs/style-specs) for more info.

## Rendering the Editor

### Using a React Component

To, render the editor, you should use the `BlockNoteView` component, and pass in the editor created using `useCreateBlockNote` or `BlockNoteEditor.create`:

```tsx
const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
```

### Props

There are a number of additional props you can pass to `BlockNoteView`. You can find the full list of these below:

```typescript
export type BlockNoteViewProps = Partial<{
  formattingToolbar?: boolean;
  hyperlinkToolbar?: boolean;
  sideMenu?: boolean;
  slashMenu?: boolean;
  imageToolbar?: boolean;
  tableHandles?: boolean;
  theme:
    | "light"
    | "dark"
    | Theme
    | {
        light: Theme;
        dark: Theme;
      };
  editable?: boolean;
  onSelectionChange?: () => void;
  onChange?: () => void;
}>;
```

`formattingToolbar`: Whether the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/ui-components/formatting-toolbar) should be enabled.

`hyperlinkToolbar`: Whether the Hyperlink Toolbar should be enabled.

`sideMenu`: Whether the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu) should be enabled.

`slashMenu`: Whether the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/suggestion-menus#slash-menu) should be enabled.

`imageToolbar`: Whether the Image Toolbar should be enabled.

`tableHandles`: Whether the Table Handles should be enabled.

`theme`: The editor's theme, see [Themes](/docs/styling-theming/themes) for more about this.

`editable`: Whether the editor should be editable.

`onSelectionChange`: Callback for when the editor selection changes.

`onChange`: Callback for when the editor selection or content changes.

`BlockNoteView` also takes props that you can pass to any HTML `div` element.
