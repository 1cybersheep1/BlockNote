# Content Structure

If you want to make the most out of BlockNote, it's important to understand how the editor's content is structured.

## Blocks

Each BlockNote editor is made up of a list of blocks. A block - like a heading, paragraph, or list item - contains a piece of content and optionally nested blocks:

<img
  src="/img/screenshots/block_structure.png"
  alt="image"
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

### Block Objects

In code, the `Block` type is used to describe any given block in the editor:

```typescript
type Block = {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  props: Record<string, boolean | number | string>;
  content: InlineContent[] | TableContent | undefined;
  children: Block[];
};
```

`id:` The block's ID. Multiple blocks cannot share a single ID, and a block will keep the same ID from when it's created until it's removed.

`type:` The block's type, such as a paragraph, heading, or list item. For an overview of built-in block types, see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#default-blocks).

`props:` The block's properties, which is a set of key/value pairs that further specify how the block looks and behaves. Different block types have different props - see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#default-blocks) for more.

`content:` The block's rich text content, usually represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. This does not include content from any nested blocks. Read on to [Inline Content](/docs/editor-basics/content-structure#inline-content) for more on this.

`children:` Any blocks nested inside the block. The nested blocks are also represented using `Block` objects.

### Editor Content in JSON

The demo below shows how the editor content is represented in code - notice that it's in JSON as an array of `Block` objects.

<Example name="basic/block-objects" />

## Inline Content

A block's content is referred to as inline content, and is used to represent rich text.

TODO: Between custom & default inline content types, the shapes on inline content objects are not standardized.
e.g. `Link`s have `href` and no props, custom IC will have props. `StyledText` can be IC itself, or used in other IC types.

I think we should have smth like this:
```typescript
// Helper types
type Styles = {
  bold: boolean;
  textColor: string;
  ...
}

// Inline Content types
type StyledText = {
  type: "richText";
  props: {
    styles: Styles;
  }
  editable: true;
}
type Link = {
  type: "link";
  props: {
    styles: Styles;
    href: string;
  }
  editable: true;
}
type Mention = {
  type: "mention";
  props: {
    user: string;
  }
  editable: false;
}
```
This is way cleaner, but means that links cannot have mixed styles. I think we either:
- Convert links to styles (they're already marks in TipTap)
- Not do anything bc I don't think having mixed styles on links is ever useful

### Inline Content Objects

In code, the `InlineContent` type is used to describe a piece of inline content:

```typescript
type InlineContent = {
  type: string;
  props: Record<string, boolean | number | string>;
  editable: boolean;
};
```

`type:` The inline content's type, such as a mention or styled text. For an overview of built-in inline content types, see [Default Inline Content](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#default-inline-content).

`props:` The inline content's properties, which are stored in a set of key/value pairs and specify how the inline content looks and behaves. Different inline content types have different props - see [Default Inline Content](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#default-inline-content) for more.

`editable`: Whether the inline content contains editable text.

### Types of Block Content

Most blocks will use an array of `InlineContent` objects to describe their content, such as paragraphs, headings and list items. Some blocks, like [images](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#image), don't contain any rich text content, so their `content` fields will be `undefined`.

[Tables](/docs/editor-basics/default-content-types#table) are also different, as they contain `TableContent`. Here, each table cell is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects:

```typescript
type TableContent = {
  type: "tableContent";
  rows: {
    cells: InlineContent[][];
  }[];
};
```

### Block Content in JSON

The demo below shows how the block content is represented in code by outputting only the `content` field of each top level block. As in the [previous demo](/docs/editor-basics/content-structure#editor-content-in-json), notice that it's in JSON.
