# Changing UI Elements

Along with the editor itself, BlockNote includes a few additional UI elements in the forms of menus and toolbars:

- [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/formatting-toolbar)
- Hyperlink Toolbar
- [Slash Menu](/docs/slash-menu)
- [Side Menu](/docs/side-menu)
- [Image Toolbar](/docs/image-toolbar)

By default, these are all included in the editor (TODO: see BlockNoteView), but you can remove or replace each of them with your own React components.
