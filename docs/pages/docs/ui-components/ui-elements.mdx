# Changing UI Elements

Along with the editor itself, BlockNote includes a few additional UI elements in the forms of menus and toolbars:

- [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/formatting-toolbar)
- Hyperlink Toolbar
- [Slash Menu](/docs/slash-menu)
- [Side Menu](/docs/side-menu)
- [Image Toolbar](/docs/image-toolbar)

By default, these are all included in the editor, but you can remove or replace each of them with your own React components.

## Default Setup

In many of the examples, you'll see we render `BlockNoteView` like so:

```typescript jsx
<BlockNoteView editor={editor} />
```

But this is actually shorthand for the following:

```typescript jsx
<BlockNoteView editor={editor}>
  <FormattingToolbarPositioner editor={editor} />
  <HyperlinkToolbarPositioner editor={editor} />
  <SlashMenuPositioner editor={editor} />
  <SideMenuPositioner editor={editor} />
  <ImageToolbarPositioner editor={editor} />
</BlockNoteView>
```

As you can see, `BlockNoteView` by default renders out four children - one for each UI element. Each child is a `Positioner` component, which controls where and when the UI element is shown.

Explicitly adding `Positioner` components as children of `BlockNoteView` allows you to customize which UI elements to show, and what to show inside them, as you'll see in the upcoming subsections.

## Removing UI Elements

In the following example, we remove the Side Menu from the editor. This is done by adding all `Positioner` components as children of `BlockNoteView`, for each UI element except the Side Menu:

<Example name="ui-components/ui-elements-remove" />

Each further `Positioner` component you remove will remove its corresponding UI element from the editor. If you only want to keep the editor itself, add only an empty fragment (`<></>`) to `BlockNoteView`'s children.

## Replacing UI Elements

In the following example, the Side Menu is replaced with a simple component which just displays the name of the element:

<Example name="ui-components/ui-elements-replace" />

As you can see, this is done by passing a React component to the `sideMenu` prop of `SideMenuPositioner`. Each `Positioner` element has a prop through which you can pass the component you want to render (`formattingToolbar` for the Formatting Toolbar, etc.). If nothing is passed, the `Positioner` will render the default UI element.
