# Suggestion Menus

Suggestion Menus appear when the user enters a trigger character, and text after the character is used to filter the menu items.

## Slash Menu

The Slash Menu is a Suggestion Menu that opens with the "/" character, and when clicking the "+" button in the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu).

### Changing Slash Menu Items

You can change the items in the Slash Menu. The demo below adds an item that inserts a new block below, with "Hello World" in bold.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-items" />

The `SuggestionMenuController` is a component which controls where a Suggestion Menu is positioned and when it opens. Passing `triggerCharacter={"/"}` means it controls the Slash Menu.

The array passed to `getItems` are the items that should be included in the Slash Menu. If you want to filter the items yourself, you can instead pass an `async` function which returns the items:

```ts
async (query: string) => Promise<DefaultReactSuggestionItem[]>;
```

Passing `slashMenu={false}` to `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Slash Menu. Adding the `SuggestionMenuController` with `triggerCharacter={"/"}` as a child of `BlockNoteView`, tells BlockNote to show one with custom items instead.

### Replacing the Slash Menu Component

You can replace the React component used for the Slash Menu with your own, as you can see in the demo below.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-component" />

The `SuggestionMenuController` is a component which controls where a Suggestion Menu is positioned and when it opens. Passing `triggerCharacter={"/"}` means it controls the Slash Menu. We also pass the `CustomSlashMenu` component to it, so that its rendered instead of the default one.

The array passed to `getItems` are the items that should be included in the Slash Menu, in this case the default items.

<Callout type={"info"}>
  If you replace the Slash Menu component as well as [change the items in
  it](/docs/ui-components/slash-menu#changing-slash-menu-items), you no longer
  have to use the `DefaultReactSuggestionItem` type. The items can be any type
  you want, just make sure you use the same one for your component's props.
</Callout>

## Creating Suggestion Menus

You can add additional Suggestion Menus to the editor, which can use any trigger character. The demo below adds an example Suggestion Menu for mentions, which opens with the "@" character.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-mentions" />

Changing the items in the new Suggestion Menu or the component used to render it is done the same way as for the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/slash-menu#slash-menu). For more information about creating mentions tags yourself, see [Custom Inline Content](TODO).
