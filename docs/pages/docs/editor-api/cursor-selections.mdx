# Cursor & Selections

TODO: refactor to use hooks?
TODO: are these examples really useful / can we come up with something better?

If you want to know which block(s) the user is currently editing, you can do so using cursor positions and selections.

## Text Cursor

The text cursor is the blinking vertical line you see when typing in the editor. BlockNote uses `TextCursorPosition` objects to give you information about the block it's in as well as those around it:

```typescript
type TextCursorPosition = {
  block: Block;
  prevBlock: Block | undefined;
  nextBlock: Block | undefined;
};
```

`block:` The block currently containing the text cursor. If the cursor is in a nested block, this is the block at the deepest possible nesting level.

`prevBlock:` The previous block at the same nesting level. Undefined if the block containing the text cursor is the first child of its parent, or the first block in the editor.

`nextBlock:` The next block at the same nesting level. Undefined if the block containing the text cursor is the last child of its parent, or the last block in the editor.

### Getting Text Cursor Position

You can get a snapshot of the current text cursor position using the following call:

```typescript
getTextCursorPosition(): TextCursorPosition;

// Usage
const textCursorPosition = editor.getTextCursorPosition();
```

`returns:` A snapshot of the current text cursor position.

### Setting Text Cursor Position

You can set the text cursor position to the start or end of an existing block using the following call:

```typescript
setTextCursorPosition(
  targetBlock: BlockIdentifier,
  placement: "start" | "end" = "start"
): void;

// Usage
editor.setTextCursorPosition(targetBlock, placement);
```

`targetBlock:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block that the text cursor should be moved to.

`placement:` Whether the text cursor should be placed at the start or end of the block.

Throws an error if the target block could not be found.

### Demo: Highlighting Block Containing the Text Cursor

If you need a visualization for which block contains the text cursor, the demo below highlights it in blue in real time.

## Selections

When you highlight content using the mouse or keyboard, this is called a selection. BlockNote uses `Selection` objects to show which blocks the current selection spans across:

```typescript
type Selection = {
  blocks: Block[];
};
```

`blocks:` The blocks currently spanned by the selection, including nested blocks.

### Getting Selection

You can get a snapshot of the current selection using the following call:

```typescript
getSelection(): Selection | undefined;

// Usage
const selection = editor.getSelection();
```

`returns:` A snapshot of the current selection, or `undefined` if no selection is active.
