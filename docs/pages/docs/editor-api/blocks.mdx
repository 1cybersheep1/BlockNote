# Introduction to Blocks

So, you've set up a BlockNote editor and your users can start writing content, organized in blocks. What are blocks exactly, and how do we access the blocks from code?

## Editor Functions

The `editor` returned from `useBlockNote` exposes functions to access and update blocks.
We'll go through the full API later, but let's start with a simple example that shows the document (a list of blocks) in JSON.
Play around with the editor to see how blocks are represented in JSON.

<Example name="basic/block-objects" />

## Block Objects

So, BlockNote is centered around the idea of blocks. A block - like a heading, paragraph, or list item - contains a piece of content and optionally nested blocks:

<img src="/img/screenshots/block_structure.png" alt="image" style={{width: "100%"}} />

In code, the `Block` type is used to describe any given block in the editor:

```typescript
type Block = {
  id: string;
  type: string; // the block type, e.g. 'paragraph', 'heading'
  props: Record<string, any>; // exact props depends on the Block type
  content: InlineContent[] | TableContent;
  children: Block[];
};

```





`id:` The block's ID. Multiple blocks cannot share a single ID, and a block will keep the same ID from when it's created until it's removed.

`type:` The block's type, such as a paragraph, heading, or list item. For an overview of built-in block types, see [Built-In Block Types](/docs/block-types#built-in-block-types).

`props:` The block's properties, which are stored in a set of key/value pairs and specify how the block looks and behaves. Different block types have different props - see [Block Types & Properties](/docs/block-types) for more.

`content:` The block's rich text content, represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. This does not include content from any nested blocks. [Table](/docs/block-types#table) blocks are slightly different, as they contain `TableContent`, where each table cell is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. For more information on `InlineContent` and `TableContent` objects, visit [Inline Content](/docs/inline-content).

`children:` Any blocks nested inside the block. The nested blocks are also represented using `Block` objects.
