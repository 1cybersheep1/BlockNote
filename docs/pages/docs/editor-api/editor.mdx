# Editor Setup

While you can get started with BlockNote in minutes, it's likely that you'll
want to customize its features and functionality to better suit your app.

## Editor Options

There are a number of options that you can pass to `useCreateBlockNote()`, which you
can use to customize the editor. You can find the full list of these below:

```typescript
export type BlockNoteEditorOptions = Partial<{
  initialContent: PartialBlock[];
  domAttributes: Record<string, string>;
  slashMenuItems: ReactSlashMenuItem[];
  defaultStyles: boolean;
  uploadFile: (file: File) => Promise<string>;
  collaboration: CollaborationOptions;
  blockSpecs: BlockSpecs;
  inlineContentSpecs: InlineContentSpecs;
  styleSpecs: StyleSpecs;
}>;
```

`initialContent:` The content that should be in the editor when it's created, represented as an array of [partial block objects](/docs/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks).

`domAttributes:` An object containing HTML attributes that should be added to various DOM elements in the editor. See [Adding DOM Attributes](/docs/theming#adding-dom-attributes) for more.

`slashMenuItems:` The commands that are listed in the editor's [Slash Menu](/docs/slash-menu). If this option isn't defined, a default list of commands is loaded.

`defaultStyles`: Whether to use the default font and reset the styles of `<p>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`, etc. elements that are used in BlockNote. Defaults to true if undefined.

`uploadFile`: A function which handles file uploads and eventually returns the URL to the uploaded file. Used by the [Image Toolbar](/docs/image-toolbar).

`collaboration`: Options for enabling real-time collaboration. See [Collaboration](/docs/collaboration) for more info.

`blockSpecs` (_advanced_): _advanced_ Specifications for Custom Blocks. See [Block Specs](/docs/block-specs) more info.

`inlineContentSpecs` (_advanced_): Specifications for Custom Inline Content. See [Inline Content Specs](/docs/inline-content-specs) for more info.

`styleSpecs` (_advanced_): Specifications for Custom Styles. See [Style Specs](/docs/style-specs) for more info.

## `useBlockNote`

## `BlockNoteView`

- editable
- events

### Removing UI Elements

TODO: probably just explain the props of BlockNoteView

In the following example, we remove the Side Menu from the editor. This is done by adding all `Positioner` components as children of `BlockNoteView`, for each UI element except the Side Menu:

<Example name="ui-components/ui-elements-remove" />

Each further `Positioner` component you remove will remove its corresponding UI element from the editor. If you only want to keep the editor itself, add only an empty fragment (`<></>`) to `BlockNoteView`'s children.
