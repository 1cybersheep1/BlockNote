# Overriding CSS

You can change any styles applied to the editor by adding your own CSS rules. If you just want to quickly change the basic look of the editor, [Themes](TODO) might be more useful.

In the demo below, we create additional CSS rules to add some simple styling to the editor, and also make all hovered slash menu items blue:

<Example name="theming/theming-css" />
