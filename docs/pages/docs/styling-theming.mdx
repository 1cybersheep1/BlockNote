You can completely change the look and feel of the BlockNote editor. Change basic styling quickly with theme CSS variables, or apply more complex styles with additional CSS rules. If you want to change, remove, or entirely replace the React components for menus & toolbars, see [UI Components](/docs/ui-components).
