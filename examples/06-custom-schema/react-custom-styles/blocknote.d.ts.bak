/*
 * Experimental!
 * You can use a file like this (blocknote.d.ts) to automatically override types with your custom schema.
 * This way, you can just use types like `PartialBlock`, `Block`, `BlockNoteEditor` and they'll automatically
 * use the types from your custom schema.
 *
 * (the reason is that this is not used in the examples, is that we use multiple BlockNote instances in the website / example projects. This method does not work well with that.)
